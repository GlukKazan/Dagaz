   (title "Elephant Hunt")
   (description "In Elephant Hunt, one player starts with eight Pygmy hunters, and one Shaman.
                 The other has one large piece representing the Elephant.  The Elephant is so big
                 that it occupies four squares of the board at once, and moves two squares at a
                 time.  The Elephant tramples the Pygmies by moving onto occupied squares.
                 In order to kill the Elephant, the Pygmies must attack all four squares of it
                 at once; in other words, all four squares occupied by the Elephant must be under
                 attack (check) and then a move to one of these squares captures the Elephant and
                 ends the game.  The Elephant wins if it tramples Pygmies until only four are left.")
   (history "Elephant Hunt is a traditional game played by the Ituri Pygmies.  The board is
             usually marked on the groumd and rocks are used as playing tokens, a bigger rock
             signifying the Elephant.  This ritual game is played among tribesmen (women are
             excluded) to forecast the outcome of a planned elephant hunt.  If the player of
             the Elephant wins, this is regarded as a bad omen and the hunt is postponed.  The
             number of `Pygmies` trampled by the `Elephant` before it is brought down also has
             oracular significance.\\
             The first written reference to the game of Elephant Hunt was found in the diaries
             of father Maurice Morceau, a French missionary who dissappeared without a trace
             in 1821 while on a mission to the Ituri forest.  His personal effects, including
             the diaries, were later found in a cannibal village by an anthropological expedition.\
             Elephant Hunt was implemented for Zillions by Freederick in 2004.")
